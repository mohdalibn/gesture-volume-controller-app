This is a **Gesture Volume Controller App** in which the User is able to control to their **Main System Volume** using their **Thumb & Index Fingers Gestures**. The App was made using a **Python Library** called **EEL** used to make **Electron-like GUI Apps**. **HTML, CSS**, were used for the **App Layout & Styling**, and **JavaScript** was used **to implement logic in the frontend and communicate with Python in the backend** . The **Finger Gestures Tracking & Hand Tracking** is achieved through the **Cross-Platform Machine Learning Solutions Library called Mediapipe** loaded using **OpenCV Python** and served through my custom **Hand Tracking Library**. The **User Interface(UI) Prototype** was designed in **Figma**. There are two buttons: **Open Webcam & Close Webcam**, which allow the User to turn on their webcam video feed and use the App or turn it off respectively. Just below the buttons, there is a **Statistics Board** that displays the **Video Frame Rate (FPS)**, the **Center x-axis(XPOS1) & y-axis(YPOS1)** positions of Thumb, and the **Center x-axis(XPOS2) & yaxis(YPOS2)** of the Index Finger. **This project has only been tested in Windows**.
